# Semester Project Proposal

For this project I would like to create a website for a small car detailing business. The business itself does not exist but it seems like a fun way to learn the different technologies we will be taught in class. This site will contain these features:
- Home page
- About
- Contact
- Services offered and prices
- A review/testimonial page for customers where they can add photos
- FAQ page
- Be able to manipulate a review they have already created

A user would need an account in order to leave a review, which is where the authentication requirement would be met.
